# Glitch Game Engine


This is the home of _Glitch_, my small and simple game engine. Glitch is written in C# and built on .NET Core which means it can run on Mac, Windows and Linux.

## Getting Started

First, build and run the Glitch engine

```
$ cd src/Glitch
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet run
```

## Prerequisits

Make sure you have .NET Core 2 installed
